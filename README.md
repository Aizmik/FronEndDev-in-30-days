# Challenge

So after a 3-year break, I've decided to return to software development.


To show that it's incredibly easy to learn, in 30 days I'll go from a total novice in website building to a hired professional.


If you doubt that I forgot everything about software development, you're wrong. For the last hour, I have been trying to remember how to create a git repo and commit files to it.


I'll formulate the challenge a little bit later; I now have responsibilities to complete. ☺️




## Day 4 

Today I finally completed copying the website, suddenly recognizing that the "Tribute Page" is a page about someone who is dead. Sorry, doggie, I thought you were alive and still slaying, but rip Mollie.

Also, this is the first day where I actually watched a software development YouTube video for fun. Hello? Something is definitely wrong here.



## Day 5 

Whoah, I'm up for a little bit of challenge - because just in 25 days I would have to send out resumes, but my skills are stallig for now. Today we'll be recreating the traackr website.

(I almoust forgot to commit, what a dummy)

Spent a good 2 hours setting up personal VPN and registering on twihter (probably a mistake, but I want to document my process there too so I could grasp a little bit of clout which will help me find a job)

## Day 6 
I have two problems: 
* Low attention span
* Limited time 

Usually I spend 30% of the scheduled time for software development just looking up something cool, which is __VERY__ uncool

Plan: Finish copying the "landing" version of this website. 


Whoah, who knew that I would need JS for this sliding menu joke.
Going to take a break (actually work rn) because after 3 hours brain turns into a mush (not that I was studying the whole time, but you know, you know)


## Day 7 

So yesterday I not only recreated the navigation menu, I would say there was an improvement. Today the plan is simple - Do a little bit of JS and make it appear on a button click and fininsh the rest.

Real talk thought, I REALLY love this challenge, coding again gives me an incredible feeling, I literally looking forward to it and wish that I would code a little bit more instead of editing : ) 

Thought I would have to take a break because the annual potato planting trip is on the way - so let's fininsh this website now!

One day I will stop overestimating my powers. 

But not today, bich 

As you could see I've spent too much time trying to make the dawg say allways on screen and though that 

```
display: sticky;
top: 101px;
```
