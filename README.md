# Challenge

So after a 3-year break, I've decided to return to software development.


To show that it's incredibly easy to learn, in 30 days I'll go from a total novice in website building to a hired professional.


If you doubt that I forgot everything about software development, you're wrong. For the last hour, I have been trying to remember how to create a git repo and commit files to it.


I'll formulate the challenge a little bit later; I now have responsibilities to complete. ☺️




## Day 4 

Today I finally completed copying the website, suddenly recognizing that the "Tribute Page" is a page about someone who is dead. Sorry, doggie, I thought you were alive and still slaying, but rip Mollie.

Also, this is the first day where I actually watched a software development YouTube video for fun. Hello? Something is definitely wrong here.
