# Challenge

So after a 3 year long break I've decided to return to software development. 

To show that it's incredibly easy to learn it, in 30 days I'll go from total novice in website building to a hired professional. 

If you doubt that I forgot everything about software development - you're wrong. For the last hour I was trying to remember how to create a git repo and commit files to it. 

I'll formulate the challenge little bit later, now have responsibilities to complete.
